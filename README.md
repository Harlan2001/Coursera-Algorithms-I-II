# Princeton Algorithm

This repository contains my solution for the coursera course Algorithm I & II

This is the highest-rated algorithmic course on Coursera.Professor Robert Sedgewick has a knack for making algorithms, no matter how complex, vivid and simple.To be honest, KMP and network flow algorithm, which have puzzled me for many years, were enlightened by me in this course. After two years, I can even write the derivation and proof of these two algorithms.

I think the core of getting students to fully master an algorithm is understanding three things:

-Why do you do that?

-How do you implement it?

-Use it to solve real problems

The composition of this course fits all three steps very well.Watching the course videos and reading the professor's open source textbook will help students understand the nature of the algorithm and explain to others in very vivid and simple terms why the algorithm looks the way it does.

Once you understand the algorithms, you can read the professor's code implementations of all the data structures and algorithms that are taught in the course.Note that these are not demo implementations, but industrial implementations that are highly efficient, from annotations to variable naming, and are fairly modularized and high quality code.I learned a lot from this code.

Finally, the most exciting part of this course, 10 high-quality projects, all with background descriptions of practical problems, rich test samples, and automatic scoring system (code style is also part of the scoring).Let the students appreciate the charm of algorithm in real life.
